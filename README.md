# FoodNetworks
The goal is to explore how graphs can be used for all kinds of applications you may not have considered to be typically associated with computer science. In this case, we will be working with food. Applications of CS to food-related issues have become more important, and cover a range of topics. For example, we can use CS to model the spread of plant disease, to study weather conditions and their effect on food production, to optimize transportation and food distribution networks, and even to analyze recipes and suggest novel ways to combine ingredients.

This Assignment was for CSCA48, completed using C and the fundamental principles surrounding linked-lists, recursion, adjacency matricies, and graphs.
