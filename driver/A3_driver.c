/*
 * CSC A48 - Assignment 3 driver
 * 
 * This driver is *very* different from the ones for A1 and A2.
 * 
 * For the previous 2 assignments, and through the exercises
 * you have solved so far, we have been helping you develop and
 * improve your skills for testing code and verything it is
 * *correct*. 
 * 
 * So, this driver only does the basic functionality of
 * calling the functions that set-up a graph, and shows you
 * how to call the functions that you have to implement.
 * 
 * Defining the tests you have to run on your code, and 
 * determining whether the code is correct, is up to you.
 * 
 * *You will NOT submit this file* - but you obviously want
 * to make sure you run sufficient and thorough testing of
 * all components of your A3 solution to avoid any problems
 * when we auto-mark it.
 * 
 * Suggestions: Test for *correctness*, not output. As we
 * have explained before - you can write code that produces
 * the right output and still is completely wrong in terms of
 * what it does to solve a problem.
 * 
 * So, think carefully about the correctness aspect of your
 * solution, see the post on Piazza on how to test your
 * code (it's old by now, but pinned), and remember your
 * notes for Unit 5 - the section on how to debug recursive
 * code.
